Please note that classroom is not an attribute of a misconduct or suspension event. Given this information, this report contains the approximate classroom assignment around the time of the event. For high school students in particular, the system does not capture the course the student was in at the time the event occurred. 

Please note that groups of fewer than ten students have been redacted for privacy reasons pursuant to the Illinois School Students Records Act and the Family Educational Records Privacy Act (FERPA).

Also note that CPS has made a public data set showing suspension and expulsion data available on its website at cps.edu/schooldata.com

If you have any questions, please contact our office at 773-553-1602.

Thank you for using the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center.

Sincerely,

Andrew Mason

Freedom of Information Act Officer
